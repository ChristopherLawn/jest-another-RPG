## **Installation**
1. In order to run the application, download & install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) on your local device.  ***Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.***
2. After installing Node, clone the [Just Another RPG repository](https://github.com/ChristopherLawn/jest-another-RPG) to a project folder on your local device.
3. Open Bash and navigate to the root directory of the project folder.
4. Install all required dependencies for the project by entering the code:
    `npm install`.

## **Usage**
1. Once the dependencies are installed, run the app from the command line in Bash by entering the code:
    `node app`.  This will initiate a series of prompts.
2. Enter your Player name.
3. Each round, face off against enemies and choose your destiny wisely:
    * Choose 'Attack' to attack the enemy
    * Choose 'Use potion' to increase the Player's attack damage, health level, and agility.  Be careful!  Each time you use a potion, you are left unguarded against enemy attacks.
4. Defeat all enemies before they defeat you!
